A gameboy game written in C with GBDK

This is my first attempt at writing a "full" gameboy game. It's extremely simple and I plan on adding to it as I learn more C and how to better implement features from the GBDK engine. I owe my utmost thanks to the youtube channel "GamingMonsters" for providing tutorials on how to code for gameboy. The code is heavily based off of what I learned. 

Instructions:
Use the joypad to avoid colliding with a boat that is chasing you. Everytime the boat goes off screen the game will get faster.
